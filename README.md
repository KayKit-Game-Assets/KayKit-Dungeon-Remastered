The **Dungeon Remastered Pack** is a bundle of game assets that contains over **200 stylised 3D Dungeon assets and props!**

### Contents

- Walls, floors, stairs, doors, everything you can think of to make your ideal dungeon layout.
- Props like chests, barrels, chairs, tables, crates, traps, banners, and more to satisfy your inner interior dungeon-decorator.

### Features
- Modular design makes it easy to build levels and set up a beautiful scene.
- Low poly optimized models, suitable for all ranges of games, including mobile.
- Textured using a single gradient atlas texture (1024x1024) that can be downsampled to 128x128 for further optimization
- Free for personal and commercial use, no attribution required. (CC0 Licensed)
- Included files are .FBX, .GLTF, and .OBJ. The files are compatible with pretty much any 3D game engine on the market (including Unity, Godot, Unreal Engine, Roblox, and more).
